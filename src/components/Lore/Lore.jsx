        <h1>The Setup</h1>

        <p>
          Journey with us into the deepest darkest depths of some guy from the
          1920s, probably in Hawaii or something. That’s not the point, the
          point is we’re going inside this guy and into his liver in order to
          tell this story. And trust us, it’s a story that’s been begging to be
          told.

          Tired of plot lines that involve no continuity or cleverness because
          the characters have some kind of plot armor like a superpower or
          special ability that saves them from every conceivable problem? Well,
          too bad, because it’s an insanely useful narrative device and we’re
          probably gonna end up using it at some point.

          But seriously. I created this fictional universe the way I did because
          I wanted some rules to work with so that we can’t just do anything we
          want however we want. We have to make it fit with the setting of the
          plot - the inside some guy’s liver. This way, we can seem clever and
          if we really do it right, we might get some people reacting with
          &#129327; emojis on twitter and shit.

          Plasma Beach is located in Plasmodia County, which is on the coast of
          the Caudate Peninsula in the Republic of Liverpool.
        </p>
        <p>
          You might notice that most of the citizens of Plasma Beach are Purple
          People, and in fact, that’s true for all of Plasmodia County. Purple
          People is actually just a slang term tho, the scientific name for
          these people is Plasmodium Falciparum. The Purple People are recent
          immigrants to the Republic of Liverpool. Before they arrived, Plasma
          Beach was like anywhere else in the Republic, but the Purple People
          have advanced technology quickly since settling in the area and are
          now an economic leader in the Republic.

          Our story is about the Cespedes family, a typical purple family living
          in Plasma Beach. Between Steve’s gravity for trouble, Greyceli’s
          academic excellence in science and technology, and their younger
          brother’s obsession with spying, the family will find themselves at
          the center of a dark discovery, and they’ll have to step up in the
          moment and do things they never thought they’d be doing - if they want
          to save the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          I know, typical, right? Everybody's always saving the world. But hear
          me out, every time you get sick, some organisms inside your body
          literally have to step up and save the world to prevent you from dying
          so it's really not that farfetched in this case.
