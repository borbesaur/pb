      <h1>Welcome To Plasma Beach</h1>

      <p>The World’s first crowd-sourced, NFT-based cartoon show. </p>

      <p>
        Plasma Beach is a sleepy beachside community located in the caudate lobe
        of some guy’s liver. All the happenings, all the drama, all the trials
        and tribulations our characters will endure will all happen at the
        microscopic level. Like the Magic School Bus or that one episode of Rick
        and Morty. We already have the plot for 4 seasons of animated adventures
        but we need you to help us build the narrative! (And raise the money)
      </p>
      <p>
        All of our NFTs will double as membership cards to access our
        stakeholders area in the discord server. All stakeholders will get a say
        in how the story unfolds in Plasma Beach and will be able to offer
        feedback in real time as the show is being made. Stakeholders will also
        be rewarded with profit sharing at every phase where profit happens.
